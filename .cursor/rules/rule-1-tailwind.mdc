# How to handles styling based on tailwind base config files 


- Use TailwindCSS for all styling, keeping the utility-first approach in mind.
- always refere to [tailwind.css](mdc:src/assets/styles/tailwind.css) and [tailwind.config.cjs](mdc:tailwind.config.cjs) for consistency of styling used.
    - If the developer demand some styling that falls out of these files directives, identify if it is a particular case or if it could be added a new styling directive to these configuration files.
